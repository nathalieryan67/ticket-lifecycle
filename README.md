Agents view live tickets in the Agent Panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agent(s) and ensure proper Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are applied.

In our example, the ticket priority is set to Emergency due to its potential detrimental impact on a critical business area. The SLA plan has been updated accordingly, and the ticket is assigned to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers can set their own SLA plans.

The assigned agent works the issue, making sure to communicate with the user at regular intervals. For our example, the agent identified the cause of the problem as being personal networking issues on the userâ€™s end. The status was set to Resolved and an internal note was added to inform all agents involved that the customer was upset. The message between agents emphasized handling the issue with empathy as well as urgency during follow-up communication with the user. As the issue was resolved successfully, the ticket was closed.
